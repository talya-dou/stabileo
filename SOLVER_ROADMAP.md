# Dedaliano Solver Roadmap

## Purpose

This document is the `solver roadmap`.

It is for:
- solver mechanics
- numerical robustness
- validation and benchmark sequencing
- verification strategy sequencing
- performance and scale work

It is not the product, market, or revenue roadmap.
For that, see [`PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`](/Users/unbalancedparen/projects/dedaliano/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md).

For current capability and validation status, see [`BENCHMARKS.md`](/Users/unbalancedparen/projects/dedaliano/BENCHMARKS.md).

## Current Frontier

The main remaining work is no longer missing basic solver categories. It is:

- shell workflow maturity
- solver-path consistency
- diagnostics and explainability
- verification hardening
- performance and scale
- deeper reference-benchmark coverage on the newest advanced paths
- long-tail nonlinear maturity on hard real models

## What Still Separates Dedaliano From The Strongest Open Solvers

Based on the comparison against projects like OpenSees, Code_Aster, and Kratos, the remaining gaps are not “missing the basics.” They are:

1. `Shell endgame maturity`
   Strong MITC4 coverage now exists, but broader curved-shell workflows, distortion robustness, and the hemisphere / membrane-locking decision still separate Dedaliano from the strongest mature shell stacks.

2. `Long-tail nonlinear maturity`
   More years of hardened edge cases are still needed in mixed nonlinear workflows:
   - contact + nonlinear + staging
   - shell + nonlinear interaction
   - difficult convergence cases

3. `Performance / scale maturity`
   Sparse-first 3D is now real, but the solver still needs stronger large-model runtime discipline, ordering quality, and broader sparse-path reuse.

4. `Full solver-path consistency`
   Dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, shell vs frame-shell mixed, and advanced nonlinear paths must keep converging to the same behavior.

5. `Benchmark moat expansion`
   Dedaliano is already strong here, but broader external-reference proof is also the most realistic path to becoming the best open structural solver.

This changes the strategic target:

- not `be broader than every open-source mechanics framework`
- but `be the strongest open structural solver product with the deepest visible proof of correctness`

## Ranked Priorities

If the goal is `best open structural solver`, the current priority order is:

1. `Shell endgame maturity`
   Finish the remaining shell program cleanly:
   - curved-shell validation
   - distortion robustness
   - shell workflow completeness
   - clear decision on whether the hemisphere gap justifies `EAS-7` or a broader shell family

2. `Performance and scale`
   Turn sparse-first 3D and current performance infrastructure into real large-model runtime wins.

3. `Verification hardening`
   Keep building the proof moat with:
   - benchmark gates
   - acceptance models
   - invariants
   - property-based tests
   - fuzzing

4. `Long-tail nonlinear hardening`
   Harden the hardest mixed workflows:
   - contact + nonlinear + staging
   - shell + nonlinear interaction
   - difficult convergence edge cases

5. `Solver-path consistency`
   Keep dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, and mixed shell/frame workflows converging to the same behavior.

6. `Constraint-system maturity`
   Finish chained constraints, connector depth, eccentric workflow polish, and remaining parity gaps.

7. `Advanced contact maturity`
   Push harder convergence, richer contact laws, and tougher mixed contact states.

8. `Diagnostics, model health checks, and explainability`
   Make failures clearer, model issues easier to detect, and hard solves easier to understand.

9. `Reference benchmark expansion`
   Keep growing external-reference proof for contact, fiber 3D, SSI, creep/shrinkage, and broader shell workflows.

10. `Reduction, staged/PT coupling, and other second-tier depth`
    Mature the scale-oriented and long-term workflow layers after the core solver-quality gaps above are tighter.

## Current Sequence

The current near-term sequence is:

1. `Shell benchmark and acceptance gates`
   Make shell benchmark and shell acceptance suites explicit release gates.

2. `Shell-driven mechanics fixes`
   Use those gates to drive targeted fixes in:
   - load vectors
   - modal/buckling consistency
   - distortion tolerance
   - mixed tri/quad and beam-shell workflows
   - stress-recovery consistency

3. `Full-model performance work`
   Use acceptance models and workflow benchmarks to drive sparse, parallel, conditioning, and memory improvements on representative models.

4. `Verification hardening`
   Expand:
   - benchmark gates
   - acceptance models
   - invariants
   - property-based tests
   - fuzzing

5. `Long-tail nonlinear hardening`
   Focus on the hardest mixed cases:
   - contact + nonlinear + staging
   - shell + nonlinear interaction
   - difficult convergence edge cases

6. `Solver-path consistency and remaining maturity work`
   Finish:
   - dense vs sparse parity hardening
   - constrained vs unconstrained parity hardening
   - remaining constraint deepening
   - advanced contact maturity
   - diagnostics surfaced in the app/API

## Priority Stack

### 0-3 months

| Priority | Topic | Why now |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shell release gates and workflow hardening | MITC4 with ANS plus EAS-4 now produces credible results (Scordelis-Lo 80%, Navier 93%, buckling 102%, modal 99.9%). Shell benchmark gates are expanded and tightened. Next: curved-shell workflows, distortion studies, and deciding whether the remaining hemisphere gap justifies EAS-7 or a broader shell family. |
| 2 | Performance and scale engineering | Sparse assembly, conditioning diagnostics, and parallel paths now exist; the next step is full-model runtime wins and broader sparse-path maturity. |
| 3 | Verification hardening | Expand invariants, property-based tests, fuzzing, benchmark gates, and acceptance models around the newest solver families. |
| 4 | Long-tail nonlinear maturity | The biggest remaining gap versus the deepest open solvers is robustness on hard nonlinear mixed workflows, not missing whole categories. |
| 5 | Solver-path consistency | Dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, and mixed shell/frame workflows must keep converging to the same behavior. |
| 6 | Constraint-system maturity | Reusable constrained reductions now exist; the next step is consistent use across solver families plus the last remaining workflow gaps. |
| 7 | Advanced contact maturity | Basic and advanced contact are present; the next layer is harder convergence cases, richer contact laws, and broader benchmark depth. |
| 8 | Failure diagnostics, health checks, and explainability | Better warnings, pre-solve checks, conditioning/reporting, and solve visibility can make the solver materially more mature in practice. |

### 3-6 months

| Priority | Topic | Why now |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | Reference benchmark expansion | Keep extending external-reference coverage as new solver paths and deeper shell/contact/fiber/SSI workflows land; this is the main moat against stronger mature open solvers. |
| 10 | Acceptance-model expansion | Grow the acceptance suite carefully around the hardest workflows and use it as a release discipline layer. |
| 11 | Model reduction / substructuring workflow maturity | Valuable once the core nonlinear and shell stack is hardened. |
| 12 | Deeper prestress / staged time-dependent coupling | Prestress exists; long-term staged PT workflows still need more coupling depth. |
| 13 | Specialized shell breadth | Curved shells, broader mixed interpolation, folded-plate workflows, and wider production shell coverage remain a real solver program after the current shell stabilization pass. |
| 14 | Deterministic behavior and numerical robustness policy | Convergence criteria, warnings, fallback behavior, and solver-path consistency should become standardized across the engine. |
| 15 | Golden acceptance-model suite | A very small flagship set of public must-pass models should become part of the trust story. |
| 16 | Result explainability and solve progress | Engineers need clearer iteration/progress visibility, active-set/yield reporting, and balance diagnostics on hard models. |

### 12 months+

| Priority | Topic | Why later |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | Fire / fatigue / specialized lifecycle domains | Important, but no longer core to claiming an elite mainstream structural solver. |
| 18 | Membranes / cable nets / specialized tensile structures | Valuable for long-span specialty markets rather than mainstream parity. |
| 19 | Bridge-specific advanced workflows | High-value specialization once the core solver is fully hardened. |
| 20 | Broader domain expansion | Additional specialty areas should come after the mainstream structural core is clearly dominant. |

## Active Programs

### 1. Shell Maturity

Focus:
- release-gated shell benchmarks
- shell load vectors
- mixed tri/quad and beam-shell workflows
- shell modal and buckling consistency
- distortion tolerance
- shell stress recovery consistency

Current remaining shell backlog:
- curved-shell workflow validation (broader: folded plates, conical, hyperbolic)
- broader shell modal, buckling, and dynamic reference cases
- better shell diagnostics and output visibility in the product

Known formulation boundary:
- MITC4 with ANS and EAS-4 is now materially stronger and benchmark-gated
- the pinched hemisphere remains a known membrane-locking limit
- the next decision is whether to:
  - stop at a well-bounded MITC4 path
  - add `EAS-7`
  - or introduce a broader shell family later

Recommended shell order:
1. broader curved-shell validation (beyond Scordelis-Lo and pinched cylinder)
2. only then decide whether the hemisphere gap justifies `EAS-7` or a new shell family

Why it matters:
Shell quality is one of the clearest separators between a strong structural solver and a top-tier one.

### 2. Constraint-System Reuse and Deepening

Focus:
- consistent reuse of constrained reductions across solver families
- chained constraints
- eccentric workflow polish
- connector depth
- cross-solver parity in forces and outputs

Why it matters:
Real structural models rely heavily on diaphragms, rigid links, MPCs, and eccentric connectivity. Inconsistent constrained behavior destroys trust.

### 3. Performance and Scale

Focus:
- workflow benchmarks
- sparse and parallel wins
- conditioning diagnostics
- memory and runtime discipline on representative full models

Current status:
- sparse-first 3D assembly is live for plates, quads, and frames (models with 64+ free DOFs)
- residual-checked Cholesky fallback to dense LU catches silent ill-conditioning failures
- memory benchmarks show 11-22x reduction on representative 10×10 to 15×15 shell models
- relative pivot threshold in sparse Cholesky catches near-singular matrices earlier

Next steps:
- runtime criterion benchmarks for dense-vs-sparse 3D wall-clock comparison
- better AMD ordering (consider external crate or improved heuristic)
- parallel element loop for sparse 3D assembly (rayon behind `parallel` feature flag)
- sparse extraction for buckling/modal 3D solvers (extend sparse path beyond linear solve)

Why it matters:
A solver is not elite if it only works well on small clean examples.

### 4. Verification Hardening

Focus:
- benchmark gates
- acceptance models
- invariants
- property-based tests
- fuzzing
- differential consistency tests

Why it matters:
This is how the solver becomes visibly trustworthy rather than merely feature-rich.

### 5. Long-Tail Nonlinear Hardening

Focus:
- mixed contact + nonlinear + staged cases
- shell/nonlinear interaction hardening
- difficult convergence edge cases
- stronger fallback and failure behavior on ill-conditioned real models

Why it matters:
This is the main remaining place where mature open solvers still have more years of hardened behavior than Dedaliano.

## Ten Next Tasks

1. Make shell benchmark and shell acceptance suites hard CI/release gates.
2. Fix shell issues exposed by those gates.
3. Use workflow and criterion models to drive sparse 3D runtime wins.
4. Expand invariants, property tests, fuzzing, and acceptance models around the newest solver paths.
5. Harden long-tail nonlinear mixed workflows.
6. Keep dense vs sparse and constrained vs unconstrained paths aligned.
7. Finish remaining constraint deepening.
8. Deepen advanced contact behavior and benchmark depth.
9. Expand external-reference validation for contact, fiber 3D, SSI, and creep/shrinkage.
10. Improve diagnostics, model health checks, and hard-solve explainability.
