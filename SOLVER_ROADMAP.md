## Current Frontier

The sparse shell solve viability blocker is resolved and runtime gains are now measured. Dense LU fallback has been eliminated on representative shell models. Sparse Cholesky delivers 22-89× factorization speedup over dense LU (22× end-to-end at 30×30 MITC4), with 0 perturbations across all tested sizes and families. Fill ratio grows from 2.6× to 7.0× with mesh size under RCM ordering. Assembly and DOF numbering are deterministic. Residual-based parity testing is in place.

Measured runtime data (Criterion, factorization only):

| Family | Mesh | nf | Dense LU | Sparse Chol | Speedup |
|--------|------|----|----------|-------------|---------|
| MITC4 | 6×6 | ~210 | 1.19ms | 0.88ms | 1.4× |
| MITC4 | 10×10 | 684 | 18.8ms | 4.17ms | 4.5× |
| MITC4 | 15×15 | ~1400 | 184ms | 16.4ms | 11× |
| MITC4 | 20×20 | 2564 | 986ms | 43.8ms | 22× |
| MITC4 | 30×30 | 5644 | 12.2s | 157ms | 77× |
| Quad9 | 5×5 | ~700 | 18.9ms | 4.2ms | 4.5× |
| Quad9 | 10×10 | ~2600 | 974ms | 56ms | 17× |
| Quad9 | 15×15 | ~5700 | 12.5s | 141ms | 89× |
| Curved | 8×8 | ~450 | 5.9ms | 10.1ms | 0.58× |
| Curved | 16×16 | ~1700 | 277ms | 109ms | 2.6× |
| Curved | 24×24 | ~3600 | 3.0s | 406ms | 7.4× |

Key observations:
- sparse wins on all families above ~500 DOFs
- dense still wins at curved 8×8 (~450 DOFs) — sparse overhead dominates at small sizes
- fill ratio grows with mesh size (not constant); AMD ordering may help
- 0 perturbations everywhere — Cholesky is clean
- at 30×30 MITC4 (5644 DOFs), sparse assembly + solve takes 0.56s vs 12.3s dense — 22× end-to-end

The main remaining work is:

- sparse assembly runtime overhead on medium/large models
- CSC construction / duplicate-compaction overhead in `from_triplets`
- `k_full` overbuilding in workflows that only need `k_ff`
- fill-ratio and ordering investigation (RCM vs AMD and beyond)
- deeper sparse eigensolver integration after the now-partly-done sparse reuse into modal/buckling/harmonic/reduction
- verification hardening around the new sparse path (determinism, parity gates, fill-ratio gates)
- long-tail nonlinear hardening (mixed nonlinear cases)
- product surfacing (deterministic diagnostics and solve timings in the app)
- shell-family workflow maturity and selection guidance
- shell-adjacent workflow breadth (layered shells, axisymmetric workflows, nonlinear shell depth)
- solver-path consistency
- deeper reference-benchmark coverage on the newest advanced paths

## What Still Separates Dedaliano From The Strongest Open Solvers

Based on the comparison against projects like OpenSees, Code_Aster, and Kratos, the remaining gaps are not “missing the basics.” They are:

1. `Performance / scale maturity`
   Sparse Cholesky runtime gains are measured: 22-89× factorization speedup, 22× end-to-end, 0 perturbations. Sparse-path reuse is now partly done across modal/buckling/harmonic/reduction. The next steps are cutting sparse assembly overhead, choosing better ordering/fill behavior, then pushing sparse deeper into eigensolver internals and broader solver families.

2. `Long-tail nonlinear maturity`
   More years of hardened edge cases are still needed in mixed nonlinear workflows:
   - contact + nonlinear + staging
   - shell + nonlinear interaction
   - difficult convergence cases

3. `Full solver-path consistency`
   Dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, shell vs frame-shell mixed, and advanced nonlinear paths must keep converging to the same behavior.

4. `Benchmark moat expansion`
   Dedaliano is already strong here, but broader external-reference proof is also the most realistic path to becoming the best open structural solver.

5. `Shell-family workflow maturity`
   `MITC4 + MITC9 + SHB8-ANS + curved shells` now form a real production shell stack. The remaining shell work is no longer basic shell breadth, but shell-family guidance, workflow hardening, and the next important shell-adjacent capabilities competitors still expose clearly.

This changes the strategic target:

- not `be broader than every open-source mechanics framework`
- but `be the strongest open structural solver product with the deepest visible proof of correctness`

## Ranked Priorities

If the goal is `best open structural solver`, the current priority order is:

1. ~~`Measure real runtime gains`~~ — DONE
   Measured across MITC4, Quad9, and curved shell families: 22-89× factorization speedup over dense LU, 22× end-to-end at 30×30 MITC4, 0 perturbations. Sparse wins above ~500 DOFs on all families. Fill ratio grows 2.6-7.0× with mesh size.

2. `Sparse assembly runtime`
   Sparse assembly is now the dominant performance issue on some workflows. Current measurements show roughly 2× memory reduction and OOM avoidance at 50×50+, but `assemble_sparse_3d` can still be 5-25× slower than dense assembly/extraction on MITC4 plate meshes. Profiling shows the hot spot is CSC construction (`CscMatrix::from_triplets` / duplicate compaction), not element math.

3. `k_ff-only sparse assembly where possible`
   Some 3D workflows now sparse-assemble and then convert `K_ff` back to dense, but still pay to build `k_full` even when they never use it. Modal, buckling, harmonic, and reduction should skip `k_full` where possible.

4. `Fill-ratio investigation`
   Fill ratio grows from 2.6× to 7.0× with mesh size under RCM ordering. AMD ordering is implemented and should now be compared directly. This directly affects factorization time and memory at scale.

5. `Verification hardening around the new sparse path`
   The sparse path is now live and deterministic. Lock it in with:
   - determinism gates (sorted assembly, merged DOF numbering)
   - residual-based parity gates (sparse vs dense solutions verified via residual norm)
   - fill-ratio gates (< 200× on representative shell meshes)
   - no-dense-fallback gates on representative shell models
   - broader invariant, property-based, and fuzzing coverage around sparse/shell paths

6. `Broader sparse-path reuse`
   Sparse reuse is now partly done in 3D modal, buckling, harmonic, Guyan, and Craig-Bampton flows. The next step is to measure those paths, extend sparse reuse where still missing, and push sparse deeper than `assemble_sparse_3d() + to_dense_symmetric()`.

6. `Long-tail nonlinear hardening`
   Now that the linear/shell sparse base is healthier, mixed nonlinear cases become more worth attacking:
   - contact + nonlinear + staging
   - shell + nonlinear interaction
   - difficult convergence edge cases

7. `Product surfacing`
   Deterministic diagnostics and solve timings are now much more valuable in the app:
   - expose pivot perturbation counts and fill ratios in the UI
   - surface solve phase breakdowns for user visibility
   - make solver-path selection and fallback behavior transparent

8. `Solver-path consistency`
   Keep dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, and mixed shell/frame workflows converging to the same behavior.

9. `Constraint-system maturity`
   Finish chained constraints, connector depth, eccentric workflow polish, and remaining parity gaps.

10. `Advanced contact maturity`
   Push harder convergence, richer contact laws, and tougher mixed contact states.

11. `Reference benchmark expansion`
    Keep growing external-reference proof for contact, fiber 3D, SSI, creep/shrinkage, and broader shell workflows.

12. `Shell-family workflow maturity`
    Keep the shell-family selection guidance current, maintain the frontier-gate benchmarks, and only reopen shell-family expansion if the current stack proves insufficient on practical workflows.

13. `Shell-family automatic selection policy`
    Turn shell-family guidance into explicit rules the UI and model layer can use for automatic defaults, explainable recommendations, and safe override behavior.

14. `Shell-adjacent workflow breadth competitors still expose clearly`
    Add the highest-value missing shell-related workflow classes:
    - layered / laminated shell workflows
    - axisymmetric workflows
    - deeper nonlinear / corotational shell depth

15. `Reduction, staged/PT coupling, and other second-tier depth`
    Mature the scale-oriented and long-term workflow layers after the core solver-quality gaps above are tighter.

## Current Sequence

The current near-term sequence is:

1. ~~`Measure real runtime gains`~~ — DONE
   Measured: 22-89× factorization speedup, 22× end-to-end at 30×30 MITC4, 0 perturbations across all families/sizes. Sparse wins above ~500 DOFs. Dense still wins at curved 8×8 (~450 DOFs).

2. `Sparse assembly runtime`
   Profile and reduce the overhead inside `assemble_sparse_3d`. Current measurements show sparse assembly/extraction is still slower than dense assembly/extraction at medium MITC4 sizes, even though the sparse path wins decisively on memory and large-scale solvability. The current top culprit is CSC construction / duplicate compaction inside `from_triplets`.

3. `k_ff-only sparse assembly`
   Modal, buckling, harmonic, Guyan, and Craig-Bampton now sparse-assemble, but still overbuild `k_full` before converting `K_ff` back to dense. Split out `k_ff`-only assembly where full reactions are not needed.

4. `Fill-ratio investigation`
   Fill ratio grows from 2.6× (10×10) to 7.0× (50×50) under RCM ordering. AMD ordering is already implemented and should now be compared directly across mesh sizes and element families.

5. `Verification hardening around the new sparse path`
   Lock in the sparse path with:
   - determinism gates (sorted assembly and merged DOF numbering are in place; add broader coverage)
   - residual-based parity gates (sparse vs dense verified via residual norm < 1e-6)
   - fill-ratio and no-dense-fallback benchmark gates
   - invariant, property-based, and fuzzing coverage around sparse/shell paths

6. `Broader sparse-path reuse`
   Modal, buckling, harmonic, Guyan, and Craig-Bampton 3D now sparse-assemble and then convert `K_ff` back to dense. The next step is to measure those workflows and push sparse deeper into eigensolver and reduction internals.

6. `Long-tail nonlinear hardening`
   Focus on the hardest mixed cases:
   - contact + nonlinear + staging
   - shell + nonlinear interaction
   - difficult convergence edge cases

7. `Product surfacing`
   Make the now-healthy sparse path visible in the app:
   - expose solve timings, pivot perturbation stats, and fill ratios
   - surface solver-path selection and fallback behavior
   - deterministic diagnostics for user trust

8. `Solver-path consistency and remaining maturity work`
   Finish:
   - constrained vs unconstrained parity hardening
   - remaining constraint deepening
   - advanced contact maturity
   - clearer solver-side diagnostics and output semantics

9. `Shell-family workflow guidance and frontier tracking`
   Keep the shell-family selection guidance current, maintain the frontier-gate benchmarks, and only reopen shell-family expansion if the current `MITC4 / MITC9 / SHB8-ANS / curved-shell` stack proves insufficient.

10. `Shell-adjacent workflow breadth`
   Add the highest-value shell-related workflow classes competitors still expose clearly:
   - layered / laminated shell workflows
   - axisymmetric workflows
   - deeper nonlinear / corotational shell depth

## Active Programs

### 1. Shell-Family Maturity

Focus:
- release-gated shell benchmarks (`MITC4`, `MITC9`, `SHB8-ANS`, and curved-shell frontiers)
- shell load vectors
- mixed tri/quad and beam-shell workflows
- shell modal and buckling consistency
- distortion tolerance
- shell stress recovery consistency
- shell-family comparative benchmark tables and selection guidance
- shell-family automatic-selection rules for default product behavior

Current status:
- MITC4+EAS-7, MITC9, SHB8-ANS, and curved shells are all implemented, benchmarked, and part of the production shell stack
- shell-family frontier gates now exist across MITC4, MITC9, SHB8-ANS, and curved-shell benchmarks
- the shell question is no longer “do we have enough shell breadth?” but “how do we harden and guide the multi-family stack?”

Current remaining shell backlog:
- shell-family selection guidance and explicit “use / avoid” rules for MITC4, MITC9, SHB8-ANS, and curved shells
- a rule-based shell-family selector for automatic defaults and explainable recommendations
- broader curved/non-planar workflow validation with the multi-family shell stack
- broader shell modal, buckling, and dynamic reference cases across the multi-family shell stack
- better shell diagnostics and output semantics in solver results
- MITC9 corotational extension (deferred)
- layered / laminated shell workflows
- axisymmetric workflows for shells of revolution
- nonlinear / corotational shell workflow depth across the multi-family stack

Decision support:
- use [`research/shell_family_selection.md`](/Users/unbalancedparen/projects/dedaliano/research/shell_family_selection.md) for current family-choice rules and default-selection logic
- use [`research/competitor_element_families.md`](/Users/unbalancedparen/projects/dedaliano/research/competitor_element_families.md) to justify why layered shells, axisymmetric workflows, and deeper nonlinear shell depth are the highest-value shell-adjacent additions

Known formulation boundary:
- MITC4+EAS-7: efficient for flat and mildly curved shells
- MITC9: higher-order shell path with better accuracy on standard shell benchmarks at lower mesh density
- SHB8-ANS: strong solid-shell option on the curved/non-planar frontier
- curved shell: preferred family for severe shell-of-revolution and genuinely curved geometry where flat-faceted families are weakest
- shell breadth is no longer the open gap; the remaining shell work is hardening, guidance, and performance across the multi-family stack

Recommended shell order:
1. keep the shell-family selection guidance and frontier gates current
2. add the most important shell-adjacent workflow breadth competitors still expose:
   - layered / laminated shell workflows
   - axisymmetric workflows
   - nonlinear / corotational shell depth
3. turn shell-family guidance into an explicit automatic selection policy for the product layer
4. only reopen shell-family expansion if the current MITC4 / MITC9 / SHB8-ANS / curved-shell stack proves insufficient on practical workflows

Why it matters:
Shell quality is one of the clearest separators between a strong structural solver and a top-tier one.

### 2. Constraint-System Reuse and Deepening

Focus:
- consistent reuse of constrained reductions across solver families
- chained constraints
- eccentric workflow polish
- connector depth
- cross-solver parity in forces and outputs

Why it matters:
Real structural models rely heavily on diaphragms, rigid links, MPCs, and eccentric connectivity. Inconsistent constrained behavior destroys trust.

### 3. Performance and Scale

Focus:
- full-model runtime and memory benchmarks
- broader sparse-path reuse across solver families
- parallel assembly scaling on heavier element families
- conditioning diagnostics
- eigensolver debt cleanup

Current status:
- **sparse shell solve viability is done**: direct left-looking symbolic Cholesky with two-tier pivot perturbation eliminates dense LU fallback on all shell families (MITC4, MITC9, curved shell)
- **fill ratio fixed**: RCM ordering reduced fill from 673× (naive AMD) to 1.8× on representative shell meshes
- **dense fallback eliminated**: wall-time share dropped from 87% to 0% on a 50×50 MITC4 plate (~15k DOFs)
- **assembly is deterministic**: all HashMap element iterations sorted by ID across dense, sparse, and parallel paths
- **DOF numbering is deterministic**: multiple supports targeting the same node merge constraint flags with OR
- **residual-based parity testing**: sparse and dense solutions both verified via ||Ku-f||/||f|| < 1e-6
- **benchmark gates in place**: no-dense-fallback gate, fill-ratio gate (< 200×), sparse-vs-dense residual parity gate
- sparse-first 3D assembly is live for plates, quads, and frames (models with 64+ free DOFs)
- parallel element assembly via rayon (`parallel` feature flag) is wired into the 3D sparse solver path
- all 8 element families parallelized through a unified `AnyElement3D` work pool
- memory benchmarks show 11-22× reduction on representative 10×10 to 15×15 shell models
- criterion benchmarks cover flat-plate (up to 50×50 = 2500 quads) and mixed frame+slab models (up to 8-storey, 8×8 slab)
- the Lanczos tridiagonal eigensolver still falls back to dense Jacobi on the tridiagonal matrix; this is real eigensolver debt
- sparse assembly reuse is now in place for 3D modal, buckling, harmonic, Guyan, and Craig-Bampton workflows, eliminating dense `n×n` assembly there
- assembly/extraction measurements show a new bottleneck: on MITC4 plate meshes, sparse assembly/extraction can still be 5-25× slower than dense assembly/extraction even though it wins decisively on memory and large-scale solvability
- profiling shows the hot spot is `CscMatrix::from_triplets` / duplicate compaction, not element stiffness computation
- some 3D workflows still overbuild `k_full` even when they only need `k_ff`

Measured parallel assembly results (Apple Silicon, release build):

| Model | Elements | DOFs | Serial | Parallel | Speedup |
|-------|----------|------|--------|----------|---------|
| 20×20 flat plate | 400 quads | ~2.6k | 82 ms | 80 ms | 1.03× |
| 30×30 flat plate | 900 quads | ~5.8k | 411 ms | 386 ms | 1.06× |
| 50×50 flat plate | 2500 quads | ~15.6k | 2.96 s | 2.91 s | 1.02× |
| 8-storey mixed | 512 quads + 32 frames | ~3.3k | 161 ms | 157 ms | 1.03× |

MITC4 element stiffness is lightweight (~200 ops), so the parallel overhead nearly cancels the speedup. Quad9 and curved-shell elements (5-10× heavier per element) will show stronger scaling.

Updated numerical-methods order:

1. ~~sparse shell solve viability~~ — DONE
2. ~~fill-reducing ordering quality~~ — DONE (RCM, 1.8× fill on representative shell meshes)
3. ~~measure real full-model runtime gains~~ — DONE
4. reduce sparse assembly overhead
5. add `k_ff`-only sparse assembly where full reactions are not needed
6. extend sparse path deeper into modal, buckling, harmonic, and reduction internals
7. tridiagonal eigensolver fix
8. sparse shift-invert eigensolver path
9. iterative refinement and Krylov solvers
10. modified Newton
11. quasi-Newton variants

See [`research/numerical_methods_gap_analysis.md`](/Users/unbalancedparen/projects/dedaliano/research/numerical_methods_gap_analysis.md).

Next steps:
- profile and reduce `assemble_sparse_3d` overhead
- compare RCM vs AMD on representative shell and mixed models
- measure the now-sparse modal/buckling/harmonic/reduction workflows
- push sparse deeper into eigensolver internals instead of converting `K_ff` back to dense
- fix the Lanczos tridiagonal eigensolver debt

Why it matters:
A solver is not elite if it only works well on small clean examples.

### 4. Verification Hardening

Focus:
- benchmark gates
- acceptance models
- invariants
- property-based tests
- fuzzing
- differential consistency tests

Why it matters:
This is how the solver becomes visibly trustworthy rather than merely feature-rich.

### 5. Long-Tail Nonlinear Hardening

Focus:
- mixed contact + nonlinear + staged cases
- shell/nonlinear interaction hardening
- difficult convergence edge cases
- stronger fallback and failure behavior on ill-conditioned real models

Why it matters:
This is the main remaining place where mature open solvers still have more years of hardened behavior than Dedaliano.

## Exit Criteria

### Shell-family maturity

Already done:
- MITC4+EAS-7, MITC9, and SHB8-ANS are all accepted as part of the production shell stack
- curved/non-planar benchmarks written and running (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere R/t sweep) — results document the flat-faceted limit

Remaining to close:
- the shell-family selection guidance and frontier boundaries are explicitly documented
- shell-family selection policy is explicit enough for automatic defaults plus manual override
- distortion and warp studies are gated and bounded
- the highest-value shell-adjacent workflow gaps are closed:
  - layered / laminated shell workflows
  - axisymmetric workflows
  - nonlinear / corotational shell depth

### Performance and scale

Already done:
- sparse shell solve viability (dense fallback eliminated, fill ratio 1.8×)
- deterministic assembly and DOF numbering
- residual-based parity testing and benchmark gates

Remaining to close:
- sparse assembly overhead is no longer a dominant cost on medium shell models
- sparse path is extended deeper than `assemble_sparse_3d() + to_dense_symmetric()` in modal, buckling, harmonic, and reduction workflows
- large-model memory/runtime baselines are tracked in CI
- eigensolver debt is resolved

### Verification hardening

Done means:
- benchmark gates exist for the newest advanced solver families
- acceptance models cover the hardest production-style workflows
- invariants, property tests, and fuzzing exist for sparse/shell/contact/constraint paths
- benchmark discipline is part of release quality, not just local testing

### Long-tail nonlinear hardening

Done means:
- hard mixed nonlinear regressions exist and stay green
- convergence behavior is predictable on difficult reference cases
- failure modes are clearer and less solver-path-specific

### Solver-path consistency

Done means:
- dense vs sparse parity is explicitly covered on representative models
- constrained vs unconstrained parity is stable
- mixed frame/shell workflows do not diverge by solver path
- result outputs remain consistent across linear and advanced solver families

## Must-Have Vs Later

### Must-have to become the best open structural solver
