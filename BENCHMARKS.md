This document is the `status and proof` document.
It should answer:
- what is implemented
- what is benchmarked or gated
- what is still unproven or immature

It should not be the main roadmap or the historical archive.

## Summary

The benchmark ledger below is curated. It is narrower than the full automated test inventory, because many validation, unit, integration, and regression tests are support checks rather than one benchmark row per test.

Current measured inventory:

- latest reported full-suite status: `5872` passing tests, `0` failures
- `25` integration test files (`182` integration test functions)
- dedicated property / differential fuzz coverage (`90` passing tests)
- explicit benchmark-gate suites for constraints, contact, shells, reduction, sparse / conditioning paths, and sparse 3D parity
- explicit CI gate stages for shell benchmarks, shell acceptance models, and constraint benchmarks
- the benchmark ledger below is curated and intentionally narrower than the full automated suite

### Fast Scan

| Area | Implemented | Benchmarked | Gated | Main Remaining Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linear / second-order core | Yes | Yes | Partial | broader large-model and sparse-path proof |
| Dynamics (modal / spectrum / time history / harmonic) | Yes | Yes | Partial | more mixed shell/frame and nonlinear depth |
| Nonlinear frames / fiber / staged | Yes | Yes | Partial | harder mixed nonlinear workflows and convergence edge cases |
| Contact / SSI | Yes | Yes | Partial | tougher mixed cases and more long-tail reference coverage |
| Shells / plates | Yes | Yes | Yes | MITC4+MITC9 multi-family stack implemented and acceptance-covered; hardening on curved/non-planar frontier |
| Constraints / reduction | Yes | Yes | Yes | chained-constraint maturity and broader solver-path consistency |
| Sparse / conditioning paths | Yes | Yes | Yes | runtime wins, ordering quality, broader sparse-path reuse |
| Design-check / postprocess stack | Yes | Yes | No | workflow/product packaging rather than core mechanics |

## How to Read This File

This file answers four different questions, in this order:

1. `What exists today?`
   The current solver/design surface, current maturity level, and the biggest remaining gaps.
2. `How is it validated?`
   The testing methodology and the role of analytical checks, benchmarks, cross-validation, regressions, and acceptance models.
3. `What exact benchmarks are covered?`
   The full benchmark ledger by design code family, commercial cross-check source, textbook domain, and engineering specialty.
4. `What is not yet benchmark-complete?`
   Regression-only items, capability-only items, placeholders, and the detailed gap inventory.

Recommended reading order:

- `Solver Capability Matrix`
- `Priority and Parity Framework`
- `Validation Methodology`
- `Benchmark Ledger`
- `Regression and Capability-Only Tracking`
- `Detailed Gap Inventory`

This document is about solver capability, validation, and benchmark evidence.
It should not carry the repo’s full business narrative or become the primary product roadmap.

## Current Coverage Snapshot

### What We Have Today

At a high level, the current engine already has:

- broad 2D and 3D structural analysis coverage
- second-order, buckling, modal, spectrum, time history, and harmonic workflows
- nonlinear frame, fiber, contact, SSI, staged, prestress, imperfections, and creep/shrinkage support
- triangular plate and MITC4 quadrilateral shell support
- constraint systems, reduction/substructuring, and broad postprocessing/design modules
- benchmark gates, acceptance models, integration tests, property/differential fuzz coverage, and a large validation surface

In short:

`the core solver surface is already broad and serious`

The rest of this document explains how proven each part of that surface is.

### What We Still Need

The main remaining needs are no longer basic feature categories. They are:

- shell hardening
  MITC4+MITC9 multi-family stack is implemented and acceptance-covered (cantilever, mixed beam+slab, cylindrical tank, modal plate); remaining work is the curved/non-planar frontier (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere) and distortion robustness
- performance and scale maturity
  especially broader sparse-path wins, runtime discipline, and large-model reliability
- verification depth
  more invariants, property-based testing, fuzzing, and acceptance-model discipline around the newest solver families
- long-tail nonlinear hardening
  especially mixed contact/nonlinear/staged/shell cases
- solver-path consistency
  dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, and mixed shell/frame workflows
- broader external-reference proof
  especially for contact, fiber 3D, SSI, creep/shrinkage, and advanced shell workflows

In short:

`what remains is mostly proof, hardening, scale, and endgame shell/nonlinear maturity`

## Validation Methodology

The benchmark suite is only one part of solver verification. A structural solver should be tested in layers:

1. `Unit tests`
   Element stiffness, fixed-end forces, transformations, mass matrices, geometric stiffness, damping terms, and postprocessing formulas.
2. `Analytical validation`
   Closed-form textbook cases for beams, frames, trusses, buckling, dynamics, thermal loads, Timoshenko beams, cables, staged/prestress sanity checks, and related structural mechanics problems.
3. `Reference benchmark validation`
   ANSYS VM, NAFEMS, SAP2000 / Code_Aster cross-checks, textbook benchmark sets, shell benchmarks, and nonlinear benchmark problems.
4. `Differential / consistency testing`
   Dense vs sparse assembly, 2D vs equivalent 3D cases, small-load linear vs nonlinear consistency, and fixture-based regression comparison across solver paths.
5. `Property / invariant testing`
   Equilibrium, symmetry, reciprocal behavior, rigid-body modes, superposition where applicable, and physically meaningful scaling/invariance checks.
6. `Integration testing`
   Full workflows such as staged analysis, time history, moving loads, harmonic response, nonlinear 3D, shell thermal loading, and multi-case / envelope operations.
7. `Regression testing`
   Every bug should leave behind a permanent minimal reproducer.
8. `Performance and scale testing`
   Solve time, memory use, iteration counts, sparse vs dense crossover behavior, and large-model reliability.
9. `Real-model acceptance testing`
   Representative building, bridge, plate/shell, cable, prestress, and staged-construction models that look like actual engineering work, not only textbook cases.
10. `Benchmark gate testing`
   A compact set of must-pass suites for constraints, contact, shells, reduction, and sparse / conditioning paths.

### Notes on Differential Testing

Differential testing is still useful, but it should not depend on a deleted implementation.

The right long-term role for differential tests here is:

- compare multiple solver paths inside the current engine
- compare current results against locked fixture baselines
- compare against external published references or commercial/open-source cross-check models

In other words, the benchmark strategy should be framed around reproducibility and solver consistency, not around parity with a removed TypeScript solver.

For the broader verification strategy, including fuzzing and selective formal verification, see [`VERIFICATION.md`](/Users/unbalancedparen/projects/dedaliano/VERIFICATION.md).

## Current Solver State

### Solver Capability Matrix

This section is intentionally different from the benchmark tables below.

- The benchmark tables answer: "what published references do we reproduce?"
- This matrix answers: "what solver categories do we actually implement today, and how close are they to best-in-class?"

Status definitions used here:

- **Strong** = real implementation with broad validation coverage and practical confidence
- **Good** = real implementation with meaningful coverage, but still behind top-tier solvers in depth or robustness
- **Partial** = implemented in a limited or approximated form
- **Gap** = not yet implemented as a true solver capability

Navier plate 2×2: 98%, Scordelis-Lo 2×2: 96%, spherical cap self-convergence 63%→92%→100%. 4 acceptance models (cantilever, mixed beam+slab, cylindrical tank, modal plate). | Curved/non-planar frontier (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere still locked), corotational extension |

**MITC4 vs MITC9 Comparison**

| Benchmark | MITC4 | MITC9 | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Navier plate (SS, uniform p) | 4×4: 93% | 2×2: 98%, 4×4: 95% | MITC9 2×2 beats MITC4 4×4 |
| Scordelis-Lo barrel vault | 6×6: 84% | 2×2: 96%, 6×6: 85% | MITC9 2×2 beats MITC4 6×6 |
| Spherical cap R/t=100 | 4→8→16: 70→93→99% | 4→8→16: 63→92→100% | Both converge well |
| Hypar (neg. curvature) | 4→8→16→32: 15→42→76→100% | 4→8→16: 24→57→100% | MITC9 converges faster |
| Twisted beam (MacNeal-Harder) | 24×8: ~0.2% | 12×4: ~0.1% | Both locked — flat-faceted limit |
| Raasch hook (150° arc) | 24×12: ~0.01% | 16×8: ~0.01% | Both locked — flat-faceted limit |
| Hemisphere 18° hole | 8×8: ~28× | 4×4: ~38× | Both locked — needs curved shell |
| Modal SS plate (f₁) | 8×8: 99.9% | 4×4: 95.8% | Both excellent |
| Buckling (flat plate) | 8×8: 102% | — | MITC9 buckling not yet benchmarked separately |

The comparison confirms: MITC9 converges faster on fewer elements for standard benchmarks (Navier, Scordelis-Lo, hypar). Both elements hit the same flat-faceted wall on extreme curved geometries (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere). The next shell frontier requires a curved-shell or solid-shell formulation.

| Curved beams | Partial | `element/curved_beam.rs`, `validation_curved_beams.rs` | Current approach is segmented expansion, not native high-end formulation |
| Timoshenko beam / shear deformation | Good | `element/frame.rs`, shear-area fields in `types/input.rs`, `validation_timoshenko_solver.rs` | Needs broader production validation across all solver modes |
| Cable / catenary element | Good | `element/cable.rs`, `solver/cable.rs`, `integration_cable_solver.rs` | Needs broader bridge/cable-net/staged benchmark depth |
| Warping torsion / 7th DOF | Good | 14-DOF plumbing in `assembly.rs`, `element/frame.rs`, `element/fef.rs`, legacy placeholder tests still in `validation_warping_torsion.rs` | Needs benchmark hardening, cleanup of stale placeholder tests, and broader mixed-model validation |
| Thermal loads / settlements / springs | Strong | `validation_thermal_*`, `validation_prescribed_*`, `validation_spring_supports.rs` | More coupled / 3D edge cases |
| Winkler foundation solvers (2D/3D) | Good | `solver/winkler.rs`, `integration_winkler.rs`, `validation_foundation_interaction.rs` | Broader SSI families beyond Winkler and tougher benchmark parity |
| Nonlinear SSI beyond Winkler | Good | `solver/ssi.rs`, `solver/soil_curves.rs` | Needs broader workflow integration, benchmark depth, and stronger mixed-model coupling |
| Constraint technology | Good | `solver/constraints.rs`, constraint types in `types/input.rs`, base solver integration, reusable `FreeConstraintSystem` for reduced/expanded constrained solves, connector/eccentric coverage, and broader constraint-force output parity | Needs broader solver-family unification, chained-constraint maturity, and workflow hardening |
| Contact / gap / unilateral support behavior | Good | `solver/contact.rs`, benchmark-gate coverage, damping / augmented-Lagrangian / friction support | 2D and 3D support exist; the remaining gap is harder contact variants and hardening |
| Nonlinear solution controls | Good | `solver/line_search.rs`, `solver/adaptive_stepping.rs`, `solver/arc_length.rs` | Controls exist, but they still need broader integration, benchmark depth, and harder-path validation |
| Fiber / section-based beam-column elements | Good | `element/fiber_beam.rs`, `solver/fiber_nonlinear.rs` | 2D and 3D distributed plasticity exist; the remaining gap is benchmark depth and workflow hardening |

| Pressure loads on plates | Good | `SolverLoad3D::Pressure`, plate validation files | Better load vectors and shell-quality convergence |
| Plate thermal loads / stress recovery | Good | `element/plate.rs`, recent plate integration tests | More benchmark depth and smoothing/quality validation |
| Prestress / post-tension FE analysis | Good | `solver/prestress.rs`, `solver/staged.rs`, `integration_staged_analysis.rs`, `integration_staged_3d.rs` | Real PT depth now exists, but coupled long-term behavior and broader workflow coverage remain open |
| Construction staging | Good | `solver/staged.rs`, `integration_staged_analysis.rs`, `integration_staged_3d.rs` | 2D and 3D staged solvers exist; broader workflow depth and time-dependent coupling remain open |
| Creep / shrinkage / relaxation response | Good | `solver/creep_shrinkage.rs` | Needs broader staged/PT coupling and benchmark depth |
| Model reduction / substructuring | Good | `solver/reduction.rs`, reduction exports in `lib.rs`, 2D/3D Guyan and Craig-Bampton support, FCS integration | Needs workflow integration, larger-model benchmarks, and clearer production usage |
| Kinematic / mechanism diagnostics | Strong | `solver/kinematic.rs`, `validation_kinematic.rs`, `validation_3d_kinematic.rs` | Better diagnostics/reporting, not major formulation gap |
| Section analysis / section properties | Good | `section/mod.rs`, `integration_section.rs`, `validation_section_stress.rs` | Needs richer section libraries and tighter integration with nonlinear/design workflows |

### Suggested Competition Scope

Trying to be "best in every category" is not a single roadmap. It is at least four separate solver programs:

1. **Building frame solver**
   Frame/truss, second-order, modal, spectrum, time history, nonlinear beam-column, staging, prestress, serviceability.
2. **Advanced nonlinear solver**
   3D corotational, material nonlinearity, path-following, post-buckling, robustness under difficult equilibrium paths.
3. **Shell / complex-structure solver**
   Better plate/shell elements, mixed beam-shell models, dynamic consistency, difficult mesh behavior.
4. **Specialized structure solver**
   Cables, cable nets, tensegrity, bridge staging, time-dependent effects, soil-structure interaction.

Today the engine is already competitive in the first program's linear and second-order core, and it now also has real entries in constraints, SSI, contact, path-following controls, fiber nonlinear analysis, quadrilateral shell formulation, imperfections, time-dependent response, and reduction/substructuring. The biggest remaining gaps are now hardening, workflow maturity, shell depth, scale, and public proof on the newest advanced features.

## Priority and Parity Framework

The sections below describe current capability and current gaps. This section answers a different question:

- If the current gap list were completed, what solver-layer capabilities would still matter to become truly world-class?
- What still separates Dedaliano from the strongest open-source solver projects?

### What Still Separates Dedaliano From The Strongest Open Solvers

Based on the current code, tests, and benchmark surface, the remaining differences are no longer about missing the basics. They are:

1. `Shell hardening`
   MITC4+EAS-7 and MITC9 are both implemented, benchmark-validated, and acceptance-covered (4 workflow models). The remaining gap is the curved/non-planar frontier: twisted beam, Raasch hook, and hemisphere all expose flat-faceted formulation limits in both elements, and the `bounded MITC4+MITC9 vs solid-shell` decision.

2. `Long-tail nonlinear maturity`
   More years of hardened mixed nonlinear edge cases are still needed, especially around contact + nonlinear + staging and shell + nonlinear interaction.

3. `Performance / scale maturity`
   Sparse-first 3D is now real, but the solver still needs stronger large-model runtime discipline, ordering quality, and broader sparse-path reuse.

4. `Full solver-path consistency`
   Dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, shell vs frame-shell mixed, and advanced nonlinear paths must keep converging to the same behavior.

5. `Benchmark moat expansion`
   Dedaliano is already strong here, but broader external-reference proof is also the most realistic path to becoming the best open structural solver.

This changes the strategic target:

- not `be broader than every open-source mechanics framework`
- but `be the strongest open structural solver with the deepest visible proof of correctness`

### Solver-First Priority Stack

This is the solver-core ordering to use when the goal is technical leadership rather than short-term product breadth.

#### Ranked Order

1. `Shell endgame maturity`
2. `Performance and scale`
3. `Verification hardening`
4. `Long-tail nonlinear hardening`
5. `Solver-path consistency`
6. `Constraint-system maturity`
7. `Advanced contact maturity`
8. `Diagnostics, health checks, and explainability`
9. `Reference benchmark expansion`
10. `Reduction, staged/PT coupling, and other second-tier depth`

#### Time-Bucketed View

##### 0-3 months

| Priority | Topic | Why now |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Shell hardening — curved/non-planar frontier | MITC4+MITC9 multi-family stack is implemented, benchmark-validated, and acceptance-covered. The next step is the curved/non-planar frontier (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere all still locked) and distortion robustness hardening. |
| 2 | Performance and scale engineering | Sparse 3D is now real; the next step is large-model runtime wins, better ordering, and broader sparse-path reuse. |
| 3 | Verification hardening | Expand invariants, property-based tests, fuzzing, benchmark gates, and acceptance models around the newest solver families. |
| 4 | Long-tail nonlinear hardening | The biggest remaining gap versus the deepest open solvers is robustness on hard nonlinear mixed workflows. |
| 5 | Solver-path consistency | Dense vs sparse, constrained vs unconstrained, and mixed shell/frame workflows must keep converging to the same behavior. |
| 6 | Constraint-system maturity | Reusable constrained reductions now exist; the next step is consistent use across solver families plus the last remaining workflow gaps. |
| 7 | Advanced contact maturity | Basic and advanced contact are present; the next layer is harder convergence cases, richer contact laws, and broader benchmark depth. |
| 8 | Diagnostics, health checks, and explainability | Better warnings, pre-solve checks, conditioning/reporting, and solve visibility can make the solver materially more mature in practice. |

##### 3-6 months

| Priority | Topic | Why now |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 9 | Reference benchmark expansion | Keep extending external-reference coverage as new solver paths and deeper shell/contact/fiber/SSI workflows land; this is the main moat against stronger mature open solvers. |
| 10 | Benchmark and acceptance-model expansion | Real-model acceptance cases should grow with the new solver surface and become a stronger release discipline layer. |
| 11 | Model reduction / substructuring workflow maturity | Core reduction now exists; the remaining work is workflow integration and larger-model benchmark depth. |
| 12 | Deeper prestress / staged time-dependent coupling | Prestress exists; long-term staged PT workflows still need more coupling depth. |
| 13 | Specialized shell breadth | MITC9 corotational extension, solid-shell for composites/contact, and broader production shell workflows remain a future program. |
| 14 | Deterministic behavior and numerical robustness policy | Convergence criteria, warnings, fallback behavior, and solver-path consistency should become standardized across the engine. |
| 15 | Golden acceptance-model suite | A small flagship public must-pass set should become part of the trust story. |
| 16 | Result explainability and solve progress | Engineers need clearer iteration/progress visibility, active-set/yield reporting, and balance diagnostics on hard models. |

##### 12 months+

| Priority | Topic | Why later |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 17 | Fire / fatigue / specialized lifecycle domains | Important, but no longer core to claiming an elite mainstream structural solver |
| 18 | Membranes / cable nets / specialized tensile structures | Valuable for long-span specialty markets rather than mainstream parity |
| 19 | Bridge-specific advanced workflows | High-value specialization once the core solver is fully hardened |
| 20 | Broader domain expansion | Additional specialty areas should come after the mainstream structural core is clearly dominant |

#### Must Do Before Claiming Top-Tier

| Priority | Topic | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Shell hardening — curved/non-planar frontier | MITC4+MITC9 multi-family stack is implemented, benchmark-validated, and acceptance-covered (4 workflow models). Remaining work is the curved/non-planar frontier (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere still locked in both elements) and the bounded MITC4+MITC9 vs solid-shell decision |
| 2 | Performance / scale engineering | Large-model reliability, sparse performance, conditioning, and eigensolver robustness are part of solver quality, not implementation detail |
| 3 | Verification hardening on newest solver families | The remaining differentiator is now proof and hardening, not only additional categories |
| 4 | Long-tail nonlinear maturity | Hard mixed workflows and difficult convergence behavior are where the deepest open solvers still have more years of hardened edge cases |
| 5 | Solver-path consistency | Dense/sparse, constrained/unconstrained, and shell/mixed-model parity all matter for trust |
| 6 | Advanced contact variants | Contact exists; the remaining step is richer contact behavior and harder convergence cases |
| 7 | Deeper prestress / staged time-dependent coupling | Time-dependent response exists, but PT/staged coupling still needs more depth |
| 8 | Model reduction / substructuring workflow maturity | Reduction exists; the remaining step is to make it a reliable large-model workflow tool |
| 9 | Specialized domain expansion | Fire, fatigue, membranes, cable nets, and bridge-specific workflows come after the mainstream core is hardened |

#### Important For Parity

| Priority | Topic | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 8 | Better soil-structure workflow integration | Beyond standalone SSI: stronger coupling into foundation, staged, and infrastructure workflows |
| 9 | Deeper staged / prestress / time-dependent coupling | The ingredients now exist separately; the remaining work is stronger combined workflows |
| 10 | Fire / fatigue / lifecycle domains | Important for specific markets after the mainstream solver is fully hardened |
| 11 | Bridge-specific advanced workflows | Important for infrastructure specialization rather than mainstream parity |
| 12 | Membranes / cable nets / specialized tensile structures | Important for specialty long-span markets, not mainstream parity |

### Difficulty Ladder

This is the approximate implementation difficulty ordering for the remaining solver-core gaps. It is intentionally different from the solver-first priority order above.

#### Low to Medium

| Topic | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Staged truss/cable force handling | Completed | This was a contained staged/result-reconstruction cleanup, not a new solver family. |
| Warping torsion core implementation | Completed | The core 14-DOF implementation now exists; the remaining work is validation cleanup and hardening. |
| Full PT depth improvements | Completed | Prestress/PT depth has moved from clear gap to implemented-but-still-hardening. |
| Public API exposure for new solver families | Completed | The newest solver families are now being exposed through the main engine surface. |
| Legacy validation cleanup | Open | Some old placeholder files, especially warping, no longer match the code. |

#### Medium

| Topic | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| SSI beyond Winkler | Completed | `p-y`, `t-z`, and `q-z` support now exists; remaining work is hardening. |
| Constraint technology | Completed | MPCs, rigid links, diaphragms, and equal-DOF support now exist in the main solver flow. |
| MITC4 integration into the main model path | Completed | The quadrilateral shell element is wired into standard input and assembly with Bathe-Dvorkin ANS shear tying plus EAS-7 membrane enhancement. |
| Initial imperfections / initial state basics | Completed | Initial geometric imperfections and residual-stress inputs now exist; remaining work is hardening and benchmark depth. |

#### Medium to High

| Topic | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Nonlinear solution controls | Completed | Line search, adaptive stepping, arc-length, and displacement control now exist; remaining work is broader hardening. |
| Contact / gap basics | Completed | Basic unilateral/contact capability now exists in 2D and 3D. |
| 3D contact maturity | Completed | 3D gap and uplift support now exist; remaining work is harder contact variants and hardening. |

#### High

| Topic | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 3D fiber / section-based beam-column elements | Completed | 2D and 3D distributed plasticity now exist; remaining work is hardening and benchmark depth. |
| Time-dependent creep / shrinkage / relaxation response | Completed | Time-dependent structural response now exists; remaining work is broader staged/PT coupling and benchmark depth. |
| Model reduction / substructuring | Completed | Guyan and Craig-Bampton reduction now exist; remaining work is workflow integration and benchmark depth. |

#### Very High

| Topic | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Advanced shell technology | Strong | MITC4 (ANS+EAS-7) and MITC9 (ANS, 9-node quad) form a multi-family shell stack with 15 benchmarks and 4 acceptance models. MITC9 outperforms MITC4 at lower mesh density (Navier 2×2: 98%, Scordelis-Lo 2×2: 96%). Full solver-stack integration: dense+sparse assembly, mass, geometric stiffness, buckling, stress recovery, modal. Remaining: curved/non-planar frontier (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere still locked), corotational extension. |

## Detailed Gap Inventory

These are the largest gaps between the current engine and a top-tier structural solver. This section is split on purpose:

- `Solver-core gaps` are mechanics/formulation work that directly determine solver class.
- `Engineering/design gaps` are valuable, but they should not be confused with solver-core parity.

### Solver-Core Gaps

| Topic | Difficulty | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Initial imperfections / residual-stress modeling hardening | Medium | Good | Core implementation exists; what remains is nonlinear integration depth and benchmark maturity |
| Warping torsion (7th DOF) hardening | Medium | Good | Core implementation exists; what remains is benchmark cleanup, mixed-model edge cases, and broader validation |
| Cable / catenary elements | Medium | Good | Implemented, but needs broader benchmark maturity and specialized behavior depth |
| 3D geometric nonlinear (corotational) | Hard | Good | Implemented, but needs stronger controls and benchmark breadth |
| 3D material nonlinear | Hard | Good | Implemented, but still needs harder benchmarks, broader workflow coverage, and tighter coupling to the newer fiber path |
| Constraint-system reuse across solver families | Medium | Good | Core constraint technology exists; the remaining work is broader reuse of the reduced/expanded constrained system across solver paths |
| Prestress / post-tension FE behavior | Hard | Good | Real PT depth exists now, but full time-dependent coupling and workflow breadth remain open |
| Construction staging | Hard | Good | 2D and 3D implementations exist; broader workflow depth and prestress/time-dependent coupling remain open |
| Creep & shrinkage response | Hard | Good | Core time-dependent response now exists; the remaining gap is broader staged/PT coupling and long-term benchmark depth |
| Plate / shell advanced elements and load vectors | Hard | Strong | Triangles, MITC4 (ANS+EAS-7), and MITC9 (9-node quad, ANS) form a multi-family shell stack with 15 benchmarks and 4 acceptance models. MITC9 outperforms MITC4 at lower mesh density (Navier 2×2: 98%, Scordelis-Lo 2×2: 96%). Remaining: curved/non-planar frontier (twisted beam, Raasch hook, hemisphere still locked), corotational extension |
| Advanced contact variants | Hard | Good | Contact exists, but richer contact laws and harder convergence cases remain open |
| Nonlinear solution controls and path-following hardening | Hard | Good | Controls now exist; what remains is hard-path validation and broader integration |
| Model reduction / substructuring | Medium | Good | Core capability exists; the remaining work is workflow integration, reduction choices, and larger-model validation |

### Engineering / Design Coverage and Gaps

These are important to structural engineering practice, but they are not the same as solver-core parity.
