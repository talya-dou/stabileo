The table above is the curated benchmark-status ledger. It is narrower than the full automated test inventory shown below, because many validation/unit/integration tests are support checks, regression tests, or formula verifications rather than one benchmark row per test.

**3369 validation test functions across 426 validation files. 3814 total registered tests across 482 Rust test files.**

Current measured inventory:

- `426` files matching `engine/tests/validation_*.rs`
- `3369` `#[test]` functions inside validation files
- `25` files matching `engine/tests/integration_*.rs` (181 integration test functions)
- `3814` total registered tests from `cargo test -- --list`

## Testing Layers

The benchmark suite is only one part of solver verification. A structural solver should be tested in layers:

1. `Unit tests`
   Element stiffness, fixed-end forces, transformations, mass matrices, geometric stiffness, damping terms, and postprocessing formulas.
2. `Analytical validation`
   Closed-form textbook cases for beams, frames, trusses, buckling, dynamics, thermal loads, Timoshenko beams, cables, staged/prestress sanity checks, and related structural mechanics problems.
3. `Published benchmark reproduction`
   ANSYS VM, NAFEMS, SAP2000 / Code_Aster cross-checks, textbook benchmark sets, shell benchmarks, and nonlinear benchmark problems.
4. `Differential / consistency testing`
   Dense vs sparse assembly, 2D vs equivalent 3D cases, small-load linear vs nonlinear consistency, and fixture-based regression comparison across solver paths.
5. `Property / invariant testing`
   Equilibrium, symmetry, reciprocal behavior, rigid-body modes, superposition where applicable, and physically meaningful scaling/invariance checks.
6. `Integration testing`
   Full workflows such as staged analysis, time history, moving loads, harmonic response, nonlinear 3D, shell thermal loading, and multi-case / envelope operations.
7. `Regression testing`
   Every bug should leave behind a permanent minimal reproducer.
8. `Performance and scale testing`
   Solve time, memory use, iteration counts, sparse vs dense crossover behavior, and large-model reliability.
9. `Real-model acceptance testing`
   Representative building, bridge, plate/shell, cable, prestress, and staged-construction models that look like actual engineering work, not only textbook cases.

### Notes on Differential Testing

Differential testing is still useful, but it should not depend on a deleted implementation.

The right long-term role for differential tests here is:

- compare multiple solver paths inside the current engine
- compare current results against locked fixture baselines
- compare against external published references or commercial/open-source cross-check models

In other words, the benchmark strategy should be framed around reproducibility and solver consistency, not around parity with a removed TypeScript solver.

## Solver Capability Matrix

This section is intentionally different from the benchmark tables below.

- The benchmark tables answer: "what published references do we reproduce?"
- This matrix answers: "what solver categories do we actually implement today, and how close are they to best-in-class?"

Status definitions used here:

- **Strong** = real implementation with broad validation coverage and practical confidence
- **Good** = real implementation with meaningful coverage, but still behind top-tier solvers in depth or robustness
- **Partial** = implemented in a limited or approximated form
- **Gap** = not yet implemented as a true solver capability

### Suggested Competition Scope

Trying to be "best in every category" is not a single roadmap. It is at least four separate solver programs:

1. **Building frame solver**
   Frame/truss, second-order, modal, spectrum, time history, nonlinear beam-column, staging, prestress, serviceability.
2. **Advanced nonlinear solver**
   3D corotational, material nonlinearity, path-following, post-buckling, robustness under difficult equilibrium paths.
3. **Shell / complex-structure solver**
   Better plate/shell elements, mixed beam-shell models, dynamic consistency, difficult mesh behavior.
4. **Specialized structure solver**
   Cables, cable nets, tensegrity, bridge staging, time-dependent effects, soil-structure interaction.

Today the engine is already competitive in the first program's linear and second-order core, and it has now entered the nonlinear, cable, staging, and improved plate/shell categories. It is still clearly behind top-tier solvers in advanced shells, lifecycle effects, warping completion, and the deepest nonlinear mechanics.

## World-Class Parity Tiers

The sections below describe current capability and current gaps. This section answers a different question:

- If the current gap list were completed, what solver-layer capabilities would still matter to become truly world-class?

### Solver-First Priority Stack

This is the solver-core ordering to use when the goal is technical leadership rather than short-term product breadth.

#### Must Do Before Claiming Top-Tier

| Priority | Topic | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Warping torsion completion | The 7th-DOF path is still not fully closed. Until this is finished, torsion capability claims should remain conservative |
| 2 | Nonlinear solution controls | Arc-length, displacement control, line search, adaptive stepping, and divergence recovery are required for serious nonlinear robustness |
| 3 | Constraint technology | MPCs, rigid links, diaphragms, eccentric connectivity, and connector elements are required for real structural models |
| 4 | Fiber / section-based beam-column elements | A major dividing line between basic member nonlinearity and elite nonlinear frame analysis |
| 5 | Initial imperfections / initial state modeling | Out-of-plumbness, residual stress, prestrain/preload, and initial stress fields are essential for realistic stability and nonlinear work |
| 6 | Shell upgrade | Better shell families, stronger distortion tolerance, and broader shell reliability are needed for top-tier shell capability |
| 7 | Performance / scale engineering | Large-model reliability, sparse performance, conditioning, and eigensolver robustness are part of solver quality, not just implementation detail |

#### Important For Parity

| Priority | Topic | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 8 | Contact / gap / compression-only / tension-only elements | Important for uplift, bearings, staged support behavior, and practical nonlinear modeling |
| 9 | More complete prestress / post-tension behavior | Important for PT concrete, bridges, and staged-construction workflows |
| 10 | Better soil-structure interaction | Beyond Winkler: p-y, t-z, q-z, nonlinear spring families, and stronger foundation coupling |
| 11 | Benchmark hardening on newest features | Especially 3D corotational, 3D material nonlinear, 3D time history, 3D staging, cable, and upgraded plate/shell behavior |

#### Later / Specialization

| Priority | Topic | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 12 | Creep / shrinkage / relaxation coupled response | Important, but narrower than the core solver-class gaps above |
| 13 | Lifecycle / degradation effects | Fire, fatigue, cyclic degradation, hysteretic damage, and related durability behavior |
| 14 | Specialized structure families | Cable nets, membranes, advanced bridge-specific nonlinear workflows, and related domain expansion |

### Tier 1 — Must-Have for World-Class Solver Status

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Nonlinear solution controls | Arc-length, displacement control, line search, adaptive stepping, and restart behavior are required for difficult nonlinear equilibrium paths and post-buckling robustness |
| Fiber / section-based beam-column elements | Distinguishes basic member nonlinearity from serious spread-plasticity analysis for steel and reinforced concrete frames |
| Constraint technology | MPCs, rigid links, diaphragms, tied DOFs, connector elements, and eccentric connectivity are essential for real building models |
| Initial imperfections and initial state modeling | Out-of-plumbness, residual stress, prestrain/preload, and initial stress fields are essential for realistic stability and nonlinear analysis |
| Robust shell technology | High-quality quads, thick shells, curved shells, mixed interpolation, and distortion tolerance are required to move beyond a good triangle-based shell core |
| Performance and scale | Large-model sparse performance, conditioning, eigensolver robustness, and server-scale solve paths are part of solver quality, not just infrastructure |

### Tier 2 — Important for Commercial Parity

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Contact / gap / compression-only / tension-only support elements | Needed for uplift, bearings, staged contact, and practical nonlinear support behavior |
| Advanced mass and damping modeling | Consistent/lumped mass options, eccentric mass, diaphragm mass, and robust damping choices are necessary for strong dynamics workflows |
| 3D time history | Required for complete dynamic and nonlinear seismic capability |
| 3D staged construction | Required for bridge, erection, and phased 3D structural workflows |
| Better soil-structure interaction | p-y, t-z, q-z, nonlinear spring families, and pile abstraction matter for foundation and infrastructure parity |
| More complete prestress / post-tension behavior | General tendon modeling, staged stressing, losses, and time-dependent coupling are needed for strong PT workflows |
| Model reduction / condensation / substructuring | Important for larger models and more sophisticated engineering workflows |
| Rigid end offsets / panel zones / joint modeling | Common in commercial building analysis and often decisive for practical model fidelity |

### Tier 3 — Specialized but High-Value

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Creep / shrinkage coupled response | Important for concrete, prestress, and long-term deformation prediction |
| Fire / temperature-dependent nonlinear response | Important for performance-based fire design and resilience workflows |
| Fatigue / cyclic degradation / hysteretic damage | Important for bridges, seismic assessment, and repeated-load problems |
| Cable-net / membrane / tensile-surface technology | Important for long-span and tensile structures beyond standard cable members |
| Bridge-specific staged and moving-load nonlinear workflows | Important for infrastructure parity rather than only building parity |
| Explicit instability / post-buckling tooling | Important for advanced research-grade and high-end nonlinear workflows |
| Probabilistic / sensitivity / reliability analysis | Important for risk-informed and optimization workflows |
| Fracture / damage mechanics | Important for advanced concrete and steel deterioration/failure studies |

### Recommended Order After Current Gap List

If the goal is "best solver" rather than "feature checklist completeness", the highest-leverage order after the current roadmap gaps is:

1. Nonlinear solution controls
2. Constraint technology
3. Fiber / section-based beam-column elements
4. Initial imperfections / initial state modeling
5. Shell upgrade
6. Performance / scale

This order improves solver class faster than expanding sideways into more specialized engineering modules.

## Roadmap Gaps

These are the largest gaps between the current engine and a top-tier structural solver. This section is split on purpose:

- `Solver-core gaps` are mechanics/formulation work that directly determine solver class.
- `Engineering/design gaps` are valuable, but they should not be confused with solver-core parity.

### Solver-Core Gaps

| Topic | Difficulty | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Warping torsion (7th DOF) completion | Medium | Partial | Needed for thin-walled open sections and serious torsion claims |
| Cable / catenary elements | Medium | Good | Implemented, but needs broader benchmark maturity and specialized behavior depth |
| 3D geometric nonlinear (corotational) | Hard | Good | Implemented, but needs stronger controls and benchmark breadth |
| 3D material nonlinear | Hard | Partial | Implemented, but still early relative to top-tier inelastic solvers |
| Prestress / post-tension FE behavior | Hard | Partial | 2D prestress/staged support exists, but not full PT solver depth |
| Construction staging | Hard | Partial | 2D and 3D implementations exist; broader workflow depth and prestress/time-dependent coupling remain open |
| Creep & shrinkage response | Hard | Gap | Essential for long-term concrete/PT behavior |
| Plate / shell advanced elements and load vectors | Hard | Good | Needed to move shells from "works" to "top-tier" |
| Fiber-based plasticity / section-level nonlinear response | Hard | Gap | Needed for advanced nonlinear building analysis |
| Nonlinear solution controls (arc-length, displacement control, stronger line search) | Hard | Partial | Required for robust post-buckling and difficult equilibrium paths |

### Engineering / Design Coverage and Gaps
